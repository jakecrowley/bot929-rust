# 929Bot

 A bot written for fun for the Maryland VEX Discord server to keep track of how many people say 929 at 9:29 AM/PM.

 This is the third iteration of the bot.. first one was written in Python, then C#, then finally Rust (take me back to Python please). I rewrote it in Rust to learn the language, this was literally the first thing I have ever written with it, please don't judge me.
